# web-api-code-quiz

## The purpose of this project is to make a Code Quiz using Web APIs. To start the quiz the user will click the start button and be presented with a series of questions they have to answer. The options are multiple choice, and they will have four options of which to choose from. After each question is answered the user will recieve feedback telling them if they got the answer right or wrong. If the user answeres a question incorrectly the timer will decrement by 20 seconds. If the user does not finish the quiz before the timer hits zero the quiz will be over. Once the user answers the final question or if the time runs out, they will recieve a score and they will be able to record that score with their initials in local storage. They can either chose to clear highscores or they can chose to restart the quiz. 

## Technologies Used: html, css, and java script
